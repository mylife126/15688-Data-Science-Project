# Multi-Feature Energy Consumption Prediction 
This is the group project conducted by **Xin Shen, Ruiji Sun, Zhonglin Cao**. The goal for this project is designed to discern the correlations among possible features that could affect the energy consumption with the CMU buildings. The project would conduct topics:
- Feature Visualization and Feature Engineering 
- Feature correlation study
- Liner Regression on time series
- Multi-feature prediction with Boosting Algorithm
